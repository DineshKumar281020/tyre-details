            <h2 class="text-center">Why fit new or the least worn tyres to the rear?</h2>
            <p>
                Whether your vehicle is front-wheel drive or rear-wheel drive, we recommend that new tyres be fitted to
                the rear axle.
                This will ensure that vehicle stability is maintained in extreme conditions of braking and cornering,
                especially on wet or slippery roads.
            </p>
            <p>
                Numerous tests have shown that it is generally easier to control the front axle than the rear axle.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the front tyres skid, the driver momentarily loses control of his steering. The action that should be
                taken to regain control
                is to lift the foot from the accelerator and to turn the steering wheel into the direction of the bend.
                This maneuver will help vehicle control to be regained.
            </p>
            <img src="details-images/image23.png" alt="Tyre Illustration">
            <p>
                On the other hand, should control be lost on the rear axle, the situation is much more difficult to
                control, because this leads to oversteer.
                In order to regain control of the vehicle, the driver should turn the steering away from the direction
                of the bend.
                An experienced driver would also find that gentle deceleration would also help gain control.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is why we at tyrestore recommend that you limit the risk of this happening by fitting new or the
                least worn tyres to the rear.
                This will enable:

            <h2>Why Do Tyres Fail??</h2>
            <p>
                Tyre defects cause too many rollovers, injuries & deaths. When is it going to end?
            </p>
            <p>
                When a radial tyre suddenly loses its tread the driver often loses control of the vehicle due to a
                blowout of the tyre or rapid pressure decrease in the remaining core.
                When the blowout occurs to a rear tyre, controlling the vehicle becomes very difficult, especially at
                highway speeds.
                This loss of control results in the rear of the vehicle swinging around to become perpendicular to the
                direction of travel (yawing).
            </p>
            <img src="details-images/image2.jpg" alt="Tyre Failure Illustration">
            <p>
                If the yawing is not immediately reversed in direction, then the sideways motion often leads to the bead
                of the tyre separating from the rim, allowing the rim to dig into the pavement or surface, resulting in
                propelling the vehicle into a roll.
                Tripping of the vehicle can also result in a rollover if sufficient amount of sideway movement occurs in
                a grass or dirt median to actually trip the vehicle and launch it into a rollover.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tyre manufacturers have known that a leading cause of tread separation is due to the design and
                placements of the belts and overlying tread.
                Also, tread and belt separations can occur due to poor adhesion of the components from the use of old
                and expired adhesives, improper temperatures, rust, unclean manufacturing facility, moisture, oxidation,
                grease, sawdust, gum wrappers, and EVEN cigarette butts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of all of the known problems resulting in tyre tread and belt separation, the leading cause of belt
                separation is the failure of the metal to stick to rubber.
                The method used most often involves plating the metal with brass and applying a rubber compound
                containing sulfur.
                If the sulfur and other compounds are not to the correct mixture, then incomplete adhesion occurs.
                Also, if the brass plating is allowed to oxidize, then adhesion will likely occur.
                If there is any brass loss to the belts, then problems may occur which affect at least a deficiency in
                the tread bonding process, if not also complete separation.

    <div class="container">

            <h2>Wheel Offset</h2>
            <p>
                The offset of a wheel is what locates the tyre and wheel assembly in relation to the suspension.
                More specifically, it is the measured distance between the hub mounting surface and the centre line of
                the wheel.
                Below is an explanation of the various types of offsets which are pictured in the graphic below.
            </p>
            <div class="offset-images">
                <img src="details-images/image45.png" alt="Positive Offset">
            </div>
            <h4>Positive Offset</h4>
            <p>
                A positive offset occurs when the hub-mounting surface is on the street side (the side you see) of the
                centre line of the wheel.
                Most factory wheels will have this type of offset.
            </p>
            <h4>Zero Offset</h4>
            <p>
                When the hub-mounting surface is centered within the wheel, it is known as a zero offset.
            </p>
            <h4>Negative Offset</h4>
            <p>
                If the hub-mounting surface is on the brake side of the centre line of the wheel, it is considered a
                negative offset or "deep dish".
                Note that extensive negative offset can potentially cause increased steering wheel kickback and place
                additional stresses on the vehicle's entire suspension.

                    The <span class="highlight">bolt circle</span> is the circle determined by the positions of the
                    bolts;
                    the center of every bolt lies on the circumference of the bolt circle.

                    The important measurement is the "pitch circle diameter" (PCD), usually expressed in millimeters,
                    although inches are sometimes used. For a 4- or 6-bolt car, this measurement is merely the distance
                    between the center of two diametrically opposite bolts. In the 4-bolt picture below, this would be
                    the distance between holes #1 and #4. Some basic geometry is needed to find the center of a 5-bolt
                    pattern: draw a line between any two neighboring bolts, and draw a line from the midpoint of this
                    line to the opposite bolt. Repeat with a different set of three bolts, and the two long lines will
                    cross in the center, thereby making the distance between this intersection and the center of a bolt
                    the radius of the bolt circle.

            <div class="content-section">
                <p>The PCD can be calculated for any wheel from the number of bolts (N) and the measured center distance

                <p>
                    A 1974 MG B is a 4/4.5" (4/114.3) car, meaning it is, again, a 4-bolt pattern with a 4.5" or 114.3
                    mm bolt circle.

                <p>
                    The most common PCD values are 100 mm and 114.3 mm. This difference arises from the manufacturer’s
                    measurement conventions—whether they are designing in metric (100 mm) or imperial (4.5 inches, which
                    is
                    close to 114.3 mm).

                <h3 class="section-title">Lug Nuts or Bolts</h3>
                <p>
                    Another thing to consider when new wheels are purchased is proper lug nuts or bolts. They are
                    usually either flat, tapered (generally at 90degrees), or ball seats, meaning the mounting surfaces
                    are flat, tapered, or spherical respectively. For example, most Hondas have ball lug seats from the
                    factory while most aftermarket wheels have a tapered lug design. If you buy aftermarket wheels for a
                    Honda make sure you get the proper lug nuts for the wheel or the wheel will not be properly
                    centered. Some manufacturers (e.g. Nissan) have used taper lug nuts for steel wheels and flat seated
                    lug nuts for alloy wheels.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Some aftermarket wheels will only fit smaller lug nuts, or not allow an ordinary lug nut to be
                    properly torqued down because a socket will not fit into the lug hole. Tuner lug nuts were created
                    to solve the problem. Tuner lug nuts utilize a special key to allow removal and installation with
                    standard lug wrench or socket. The design of tuner lug nuts can range from spline drive to
                    multisided, and are sometimes lightweight for performance purposes. A variation is the "locking
                    wheel nut", which is almost universally used for alloy wheels in the United Kingdom. One standard
                    lug nut on each wheel is replaced with a nut which requires a special and unique key (typically a
                    computer-designed, rounded star shape) to fit and remove the nut. This helps to discourage theft of
                    wheels. However, universal removal tools are available which grip the head of the locking nut using
                    a hardened left-hand thread. The success of these depends on whether there is room to use it in the
                    lug hole, and whether the manufacturer has incorporated a free-spinning outer casing to the locking

                    The offset, measured in millimeters, can be negative or positive, and it is the distance from the
                    hub-mounting surface to the rim's true centerline. A positive offset means the hub-mounting surface
                    is closer to the outside edge of the wheel. A negative offset means the hub-mounting surface is
                    closer to the inside edge of the wheel.

                    by the vehicle manufacturer. If tires are fitted with a large significant offset than those
                    specified by the manufacturer, a compromise may have to be adopted whereby a wheel with less offset
                    is used to prevent tire rubbing on the suspension.

                    reduce vibration by keeping the wheel centered. Wheels with the correct centerbore to the car they
                    will be mounted on are known as hubcentric. Hubcentric wheels take the stress off the lug nuts,
                    reducing the job of the lug nuts to holding the wheel to the car. Wheels that are not hubcentric are
                    known as lugcentric, as the job of centering is done by the lug nuts assuming they are properly
                    torqued down. Centerbore on aftermarket wheels must be equal to or greater than that of the hub or
                    the wheel cannot be mounted on the car. Many aftermarket wheels come with "hubcentric rings" that
                    lock into the back of the wheel to adapt a wheel with a larger centerbore to a smaller hub. These
                    adapters are usually made of plastic.</p>

                <p>
                    A tyre is a composite product, i.e., a high-precision elaborately assembly of materials that has
                    widely
                    differing properties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main sub-assemblies making up the tyre are as follows:

                        An innermost stet of airtight synthetic rubber, which performs the “inner tube” function.

                    <li>
                        The carcass ply, made up of thin textile fiber cables, laid out in straight lines and bonded
                        into the rubber. These cables are largely responsible for determining the strength of the tyre
                        structure. The carcass ply of a car tyre has about 1,400 cables, each able to withstand 15kg.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Lower filler, which is responsible for transferring propulsion and braking torques from the

                        Beads, which clamp the tyre firmly against the wheel rim. the bead, can withstand forces up to
                        1,800 kg’s.

                        Supple rubber walls, which protect the tyre against impacts (with kerbs etc) that might
                        otherwise damage the carcass. There is also a hard rubber link between the tyre and the rim.

                    <li>
                        Crown plies, consisting of oblique overlapping layers of rubber reinforced with very thin but
                        very strong metal wires. The overlap between these wires and the carcass cables form a series of
                        non-deformable triangles, an arrangement that lends great rigidity to the tyre structure. These
                        plies, which cover the whole of the tyre crown, perform a very complex function. First, they
                        provide sufficient circumferential rigidity to prevent elongation under the effect of
                        centrifugal force, and thus ensure a constant tyre diameter under all conditions. Then they must
                        provide, lateral rigidity, to resist sway effects. But they must also be supple in the vertical
                        direction to “drink up” obstacles. To make the crown plies, the metal wires must be firmly
                        bonded onto the rubber. Perfect bonding between these two highly dissimilar materials is
                        difficult to achieve but nonetheless essential.

                    <li>
                        The tread, which is bonded onto the crown plies then sculpted with the special tread pattern.
                        Since this is the part of the tyre that comes into contact with the road surface, it must be
                        able to withstand very high forces, and it must be able to grip dry and wet road surfaces. In
                        addition, it must resist wear and abrasion, and it must not overheat. Once the tread has been
                        fitted and sculpted, the whole assembly is vulcanized for maximum solidity.

            <h2 class="text-center">What Customers Should Know About Radial Tyres and Their Maintenance</h2>
            <p>Many motorists either don’t know how to get the best service out of tyres or don’t take the time and
                effort to make it happen, it is important that they be educated on how to maintain and care for their
                tyres. This is true for all tyre constructions whether they are radial or bias tyres. Specific areas
                where customer education is recommended are as follows:
            </p>


            <div class="content-section">
                <h3 class="section-title">Radial – feel of the road
                </h3>
                <p>Most motorists have either owned radials or are familiar with them through the experience of others.
                    However, first time radial buyers should be told to expect a new feel on the road, a feeling of
                    firmness at slower speeds. This is characteristics of radials because of the stiffer belts. This
                    firmer feel of the road and faster steering response becomes an asset at street and highway speeds,
                    adding to the performance characteristics that make radials so popular.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3 class="section-title">Inflation</h3>
                <p>When properly inflated and under load, a radial tyre has a distinctive bulge in the sidewall. This is
                    normal for radials, but makes it very difficult to judge visually whether or not a radial tyre is
                    properly inflated. Customers should be cautioned not to add air to make a radial tyre look as
                    inflated as a bias ply tyre.</p>
                <div class="text-center col-md-12">
                    <img src="details-images/image55.png" alt="Tyre Bulge Illustration">
                </div>
                <p>However, they should not be misled into accepting almost any degree of bulge as being normal. The
                    only way to be sure a radial tyre is inflated correctly is to check tyre pressure regularly with a
                    reliable gauge, following the vehicles manufacturers specification or after consulting a tyre
                    professional. For futher information on this subject go through the “importance of checking air

                <h3 class="section-title">Rotation</h3>
                <p>Tyres should be inspected periodically to determine overall wear and any irregular wear pattern
                    development. Rotating tyres as per the recommendations of a tyre professional can often deliver more
                    uniform tyre wear and longer tyre life. For futher information on this subject go through the “tyre

                <h3 class="section-title">Balancing</h3>
                <p>A balanced tyre, while improving riding comfort, also lowers the constant change in the tyre load
                    (due to bounce). The constant bouncing of tyres leads to wear of steering and suspension parts, as
                    would worn shocks, and could lead to misalignment conditions. A majority of vibration complaints are
                    a result of improper balance. For futher information on this subject go through the “balancing & its

                <h3 class="section-title">Alignment</h3>
                <p>Proper alignment is mandatory for even tread wear and precise steering. The moderate cost of a
                    front-end alignment can more than pay for itself in tyre mileage, performance and comfort. The
                    customer should be advised to check front tyres periodically for uneven wear or changes in handling
                    or steering response, which indicate misalignment. For futher information on this subject go through

            <h2 class="section-title text-center">What are Speed Rated Tyres?</h2>
            <p>There’s been a lot of talk about speed rated tyres. With the increasing customer interest in high
                performance tyres – cars – and driving, in general – speed rated tyres are gaining in recognition and,
                as a result, importance.
            </p>
            <p>So it makes good sense to understand what speed rating really is – which tyre is speed rated – and what
                kind of claims can be realistically be made for and about speed rated tyres.
            </p>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3 class="section-title">Speed rating originated in Europe
                </h3>
                <p>Many places in Europe speed limits are substantially higher than any where else in the world. In some
                    countries speed limits don’t even exist. Probably the most well known example of this is the German
                    Autobahn.
                </p>
                <p>As a result of these varying and non-existent speed limits, law enforcement and government agencies
                    needed some way to be certain that vehicles, tyres and wheels would perform safely and
                    satisfactorily at predetermined categories of speed.
                </p>
                <p>The best way to do this was to somehow rate the tyre, wheel and vehicle combinations, according to
                    their abilities to perform satisfactorily and safely at predetermined and possibly prolonged speed
                    driving.
                </p>
                <p>So in simple words speed rating can be described as “an alphabetical system of describing a tyre,
                    wheel and vehicle’s potential to travel at established and predetermined speed’s”
                </p>
                <p>Notice two things in speed rated tyres
                </p>
                <p>One – The word fast is not mentioned. Speed rating, regardless of which category they occupy, is not
                    an approval to go fast.
                </p>
                <p>Two – Tyres aren’t in this by themselves. Speed rating includes tyre, wheel and vehicle capabilities.
                </p>
                <h4>UNDER STAND THOSE STATEMENTS </h4>
                <p>To clear up another possible misunderstanding, here’s a question and then the answer.</p>
                <p>Q – Are speed rated tyres required for, why pay for some thing which is not required?</p>
                <p>A – Tyres are a combination of every thing that goes into them, and each component serves to do more
                    than just one accomplished. Tyres that are manufactured to pass speed ratings include such a degree
                    of precision that the responsiveness, traction control and overall handling of the tyre is much
                    greater and much predictable that can be found in most non-speed rated tyres. Apart from this the
                    speed rated tyres are more precise and are more capable of passing exacting performance demands than
                    the other tyres. Note that a speed rated tyre is always wanted by a person who wants

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3 class="section-title">Lapse Time</h3>
                <p>Within all steering systems, there’s a built in lapse time between the moment you turn the steering
                    wheel and the moment the car begins to turn, this time lapse is caused by several factors, all
                    natural and all a part of the car’s steering / suspension system, including gear tolerances,
                    bushing, shocks, and tyres.
                </p>
                <p>There’s a portion of this lapse caused by the steering itself. Another portion is caused by the
                    suspension, and within the sidewall and the basic tyre construction , lies another portion of the
                    lapse.
                </p>
                <p>These small time lapses are meaningless when at slow speeds, but for a person who is performance
                    oriented, time lapse can be aggravating. Speed rated tyres are built to provide responsiveness,
                    durability, traction and handling.

                </h3>
                <p>Speed rated high performance tyres cost a lot of money to produce and manufacture, without mentioning
                    the specifics of additional equipment, machinery and manufacturing space and the research which goes

            <p>
                The purpose of regular rotation of tyres is to prolong tyre life by achieving more uniform wear of all
                tyres
                on the vehicle.
                This is very important in tropical countries and for urban use. Before rotating tyres, a tyre
                professional
                should be consulted
                for rotation recommendations for specific vehicles.

                Apart from this, if the tyre shows uneven wear, ask a tyre professional to check and correct any
                misalignment, imbalance, or other mechanical problems before rotation.

            </p>
            <p>V means the tyre is suitable for speeds upto 240 km/hr. The speed rating must be equivalent to the top

            <p class="content-section">
                The tread wear grade can be used to estimate mileage or the tyre life a
                tyre can cover. For example, take a grade number of 300 and multiply by 240kms per grade point and you
                would get 72,000 kms. (Tread wear grade ×
                240 kms per grade point = expected mileage). This is the number of kms that can be reasonably expected
                from a tyre when used in <span class="highlight">non-commercial service with a good driver and good
                    maintenance.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="content-section">
                For instance, a 195 60 R 14 low-profile tyre used in most of the
                mid-segment cars, has a tread wear grade of 240. That denotes it can cover 57,600 kms. But this tyre on
                an average, on
                Indian road conditions, would not give you more than 30,000 kms. The reasons for this could be any of
                these points mentioned below:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Wrong fitment of the tyre, or the tyre not suited for the car which it has been fitted</li>
                <li>Under inflation or over inflation</li>
                <li>Bad driving habits</li>
                <li>Heavy braking</li>
                <li>Driving on low gears (increased friction between the road & tyre)</li>
                <li>Worn suspension parts</li>
                <li>Bad roads</li>
                <li>Improper rim size (breath)</li>

            <p class="content-section">
                These are some of the common reasons for the reduced tyre life. To get the most out of your tyre, make
                sure that your air pressure is checked periodically, the wheel alignment is done every 5000 kms, and the
                suspension parts of your car are in good condition.

                    on the sidewall of the light truck tyre identified on the vehicle manufacturer's tyre placard). The
                    replacement passenger tyre must have a "Maximum Load" rating at least a 10% greater than the

                <p>Tyre mixing can be dangerous. Most passenger tyres today are radial tyres. For best performance, we
                    recommend the same size and type of tyre be used on all four wheel positions unless the vehicle
                    manufacturer specified different sizes, front and rear, as original equipment. Check the vehicle
                    placard.</p>
                <p>On front or rear wheel drive vehicles, if different size tyres are used on different axles, always
                    place the lower series tyres on the rear axle.
                </p>
                <p>If only two radials are mounted with two non-radials, the radials should be mounted on the rear. If
                    tyres of different types are mixed on a vehicle in any configuration, they should not be used for
                    long periods and speeds should be kept to a minimum.
                </p>
                <p>Mixing or matching of tyres on 4-wheel drive vehicles requires special precautions. Always check
                    vehicle manufacturers' manual for their recommendations or consult a tyre professional for advice.

            <p>There are two different types of tyres manufactured today: the radial ply and the diagonal ply. These
                tyres are named and identified by the way they are constructed, as indicated by the illustration.
            </p>

                <h3>Radial Ply
                </h3>
                <p>The body cords of the radial tyre run radially from bead to bead, perpendicular to the direction of
                    travel. This radial ply body provides flexible sidewalls that effectively cushion road shock with a
                    minimum of cross ply friction (and heat) since the ply cords don’t criss cross. Two or more
                    stablizing belts encircle the tyre to add support to the body and to help hold the tread grooves
                    open for effective traction. The belt also enables the elements of the tread pattern to resist the
                    normal tendency to squeeze closed during road contact, effectively prolonging tread life.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>Diagonal Ply
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The diagonal ply tyre has two or four layers of crisscrossed body plies. This conventional
                    construction provides flexibility and two directional strenght in both tread and sidewall areas. It
                    is a very serviceable construction and one that has been a standard in the tyre industry for many
                    years.

            <div class="content-section">
                <p><span class="highlight">Asymmetrical:</span> the tread pattern changes across the face of the tyre.
                    These designs normally
                    incorporate larger tread blocks on the outer portion for increased stability during cornering. The
                    smaller inner blocks and greater use of grooves help to disperse water and heat. Asymmetrical tyres
                    tend to also be unidirectional tyres.

                    Unidirectional tyres must be dedicated to a specific side of the vehicle, so the information on the
                    sidewall will always include a rotational direction arrow. Make sure the tyres rotate in this
                    direction or all sorts of trouble’s would start on.

            <h2 class="text-center">Technology Behind the Run Flat Tyre (RFT) & How Does It Work
            </h2>
            <p>Runflat Technology increases the tyre's rigidity and heat resistance so that the tyre can support weight
                while rotating in a deflated state. The new RFT tyres meet this challenge by combining design, materials
                and construction changes that optimize the location, shape and physical property of each tyre component.
                The sidewall is reinforced allowing the tyre to carry the vehicle's weight at zero-pressure. Whilst at
                present there is no standard defined, regarding the minimum range a RFT tyre can run in a run flat
                condition, we at tyrestore feel that 80 kms at 80 kmph would be a safe bet.

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>Repairing of RFT tyres</h3>
                <p>RFT tyres have specially reinforced sidewalls to enable them to perform, when deflated, for a limited
                    distance and at a restricted speed. The quoted distance and speed permitted under these conditions
                    may vary according to the tyre manufacturer concerned. In the course of running in a totally
                    deflated or significantly under – inflated condition the tyre structure is subjected to high
                    stresses and hence may become weakened and permanently damaged rendering the tyre both unsuitable
                    and unsafe to repair. When a standard tyre is run deflated there are visible symptoms, which
                    indicate that damage to the tyre’s structure has occurred. However because of the reinforced
                    sidewall structure of a RFT tyre these symptoms associated with use in a deflated or partially
                    inflated condition are likely to be masked and not be visible even if they are present. Even a fully
                    qualified tyre professional may not be able to detect run flat damage on RFT tyres. For this reason,
                    and in the interest of safety, tyrestore does not recommend the repairing of RFT tyres.
